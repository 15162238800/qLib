Additional extra menu items
===========================

These are files are completely experimental,
unsupported, and written / tested on linux only.

Right now they contain linux-specific, hard-wired
variable and command names.

Eventually these will become fully supported on
all platforms.


To install, copy or link these right into
the houdini config folder's root (e.g. $HOME/houdini13.0/
or $HIH/ ).



MainMenuMaster.xml:
	Additional items for the main Houdini window menu.


PARMmenu.xml:
	Additional items for the parameter RMB submenu.
